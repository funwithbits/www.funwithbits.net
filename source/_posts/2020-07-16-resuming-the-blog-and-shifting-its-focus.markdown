Hello everybody again,

It's been more than 2 years since I posted on this blog. Lots of things happened in my life since then. I married, had a child, so I am not a computer programmer living in my parents' basement anymore. Today, I am resuming the blog, but I'd like to shift its focus to distributed databases, which is what I have been working on over the last few years at ScyllaDB. From time to time, I'd like to share system level knowledge like file system internals, etc. As some of you may now, I work mostly with storage and compaction. Scylla uses a log-structured approach for storing its data, meaning the on-disk files are immutable, so compacting them eventually becomes needed to keep the amplification factors like space happy. I will work hard to post interesting content to you in a regular basis.

Stay tuned!

Raphael Carvalho
