There's some magic about classical music that helps me as a programmer.
Yes, I'm definitely not the best programmer out there, but when I find it hard
to come up with a creative solution, I listen to classical music over and over
again.
I leave my gratitude here for Chopin, Mozart, Dvorak, Paganini, Vivaldi,
Beethoven and so many others composers. I'm so grateful for all those pieces
you guys have left behind.
When I'm going through a creativity crisis, I listen to your songs. I also
like to listen to them while working. It can be said that we all need to be
on a good mood to produce quality work. That's another thing that classical
music plays an important role in my life. Whatever my mood is, I listen to
classical music because it impacts my mind in a good manner. It's almost like
an infinite potion of inspiration that you can drink from.

People have different tastes, so I was thinking if your favorite genre can
have the same effect on your life. Classical rock, instrumental rock, etc,
could work too. But I don't think shitty, noisy pop music will do it.
I don't think I can find the magic in Beethoven symphonies, Vivaldi's four
seasons, Paganini's caprices in some other genre. The complexity of the melody,
the depth, the harmony in those musics are outstanding. I'm having a really
hard time here to describe it, i.e. how classical music impacts almost every
single aspect of my life. It helps me boosting my creativity and also keeping
focused on the most important things, it makes me happy when I'm sad, and also
the other way around. Yes, the latter is true, have you ever tried listening
to Chopin and Beethoven's sonatas?

If you aren't into classical music, I leave here my invitation for your to try
it out. I will help you get started by leaving some links below to some musics
from the composers I like the most. These are just the tip of the iceberg
though.

I'll start with a magical performance by the Brazilian musician Arthur Moreira
Lima which is considered one of the best Chopin interpreters:

Now Beethoven's moonlight sonata played by the brilliant piano player Valentina
Lisitsa:

I really hope you guys will give classical music a chance. I didn't listen to
it when I was a teenager. Now I love it, it's my favorite genre by far. Anyone
out there that share the same feelings? Not necessarily due to classical music,
but whichever genre you like the most.
