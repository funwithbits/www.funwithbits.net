    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody again,</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been more than 2 years since I posted on this blog. Lots of things happened in my life since then. I married, had a child, so I am not a computer programmer living in my parents' basement anymore. Today, I am resuming the blog, but I&rsquo;d like to shift its focus to distributed databases, which is what I have been working on over the last few years at ScyllaDB. From time to time, I&rsquo;d like to share system level knowledge like file system internals, etc. As some of you may now, I work mostly with storage and compaction. Scylla uses a log-structured approach for storing its data, meaning the on-disk files are immutable, so compacting them eventually becomes needed to keep the amplification factors like space happy. I will work hard to post interesting content to you in a regular basis.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
